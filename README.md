## Scripts

The project provides the following scripts for managing development and builds:

| Command                  | Description                                       |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`            | Starts the development server using Vite.         |
| `npm run build`          | Builds the project using TypeScript and Vite.     |
| `npm run preview`        | Serves the built application for preview.         |
| `npm run lint`           | Lints the codebase using ESLint.                  |
| `npm run check:type`     | Performs TypeScript type checking.                |
| `npm run check:lint`     | Fixes linting issues and outputs results quietly. |
| `npm run check:prettier` | Formats code using Prettier.                      |
| `npm run check:all`      | Runs all checks (Prettier, ESLint, TypeScript).   |
